We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to use the internet&#8217;s vast array of information, tools, and opportunities with complete confidence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Introduction<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our company collects information in different ways from Visitors and Subscribers who access the various parts of our Services and the network of web sites accessible through our Service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how our company collects information from all end users of our Internet Services (the &#8220;Services&#8221;) &#8211; those who access some of our Services but do not have accounts (&#8220;Visitors&#8221;) as well as those who may purchase Products and\/or pay a monthly service fee to subscribe to the Service (&#8220;Subscribers&#8221;) &#8211; what we do with the information we collect, and the choices Visitors and Subscribers have concerning the collection and use of such information. We request that you read this Privacy Policy carefully.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registration<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subscribers may be asked to provide certain personal information when they sign up for our Products or Services including name, address, telephone number, billing information (such as a credit card number), and the type of personal computer being used to access the Services. The personal information collected from Subscribers during the registration process is used to manage each Subscriber&#8217;s account (such as for billing purposes). This information may be shared with third parties, as stated herein, or in special circumstances.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in instances where our company and a partner jointly promote our Services, we may provide the partner certain personal information, such as the name, address, and username of persons who subscribed do the Services as a result of the joint promotion for the purpose of offering you other products and services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this instance, personal information may not be used by the partner for any other purpose. We may also generate non-identifying and aggregate profiles from personal information Subscribers provide during registration (such as the total number, but not the names, of Subscribers). As explained in more detail below, we may use this aggregated and non-identifying information to sell advertisements that appear on the Services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, with purchases, we supply our member&#8217;s contact information, to our business partners, who then may contact the member by telephone after the member purchase. Sales proceeds are collected by the business partner company. We also may supply other companies with contact information, for mail offers we believe would be of interest to our Subscribers, with or without compensation from those companies. At times we may send and advertisement for a third party product, where we collect the sales proceeds, and forward the purchaser&#8217;s information to that third party.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Company Partners and Sponsors<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some products and services may be offered to Visitors and Subscribers in conjunction with an affiliate, independent contractor seller or non-affiliated partner. To provide Visitors and Members some of these products and services, the partner may need to collect and maintain personal information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online Shopping<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At some web sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a newsletter, catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit\/debit card information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient&#8217;s name, address, and phone number. Our company has no control over the third parties&#8217; use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you order services or products directly from our company, we use the personal information you provide to process that order. We do share this information with outside parties that we do business with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online Advertisements<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our company may display our online advertisements. In those cases we share information about our Visitors and Subscribers collected through the registration process as well as through online surveys and promotions with these advertisers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in some instances, we use this information to deliver tailored advertisements or joint ventures. For instance, an advertiser or joint venture company tells us the audience they want to reach and provides us an advertisement tailored to the audience. Based upon the information we have collected, we may then display or send the advertisement to the intended audience. Our company does share personal information about its Visitors or Subscribers with these advertisers or joint venture companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responses to Email Inquiries<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Visitors or Subscribers send email inquiries to our company, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary Customer Surveys<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of products and services we offer and how we provide them to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may take the information we receive from individuals responding to our Customer Surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other customers we may have, to create broader, generic response to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Promotions<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our company may offer polls, contests, sweepstakes, drawings, games, content, or other promotions that are sponsored by or co-branded with third parties. You may be entered in a sweepstakes, contest, or other promotion, simply by making a purchase from us or by providing us with personally identifiable information for some other reason or purpose. Due to these third party relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily submit to our company. Our company has no control over third parties&#8217; use of this information.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, personally identifiable information may be collected when you order products, enter contests, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our Services such as our online newsletters, or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include but may not be limited to: name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card information, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services. Our sponsors or third parties may send you material that relates to our company&#8217;s services, products or activities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Special Cases<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is our company&#8217;s policy to use or share the personal information about Visitors or Subscribers in ways described herein without additional notice or means to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, we may disclose personal information about Visitors or Subscribers, or information regarding your use of the Services or web sites accessible through our Services, for any reason if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is reasonable to do so, including: credit agencies, collection agencies, merchant database agencies, law enforcement, or to satisfy laws, such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the Child Online Privacy Act, regulations, or governmental or legal requests for such information; to disclose information that is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Use and Service, or other user policies; to operate the Services properly; or to protect our company and our Subscribers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Browser Level Information<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>TheQuietum Plus, Inc. web servers may automatically collect information about a site user&#8217;s IP address, browser type and the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on the website or not) and which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on the website or not) by reading this information from the user&#8217;s browser (information provided by every user&#8217;s browser).
